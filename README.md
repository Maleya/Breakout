# Breakout

Learning to play Breakout through reinforcement learning, implementing the DQN algorithm described in the article '[Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf)'.  *This is still very much a work in progress* 



## File structure

The main algorithm is started from **DQN_algorithm.py** which in turn loads a few helper files.

* DQN_agent 
* NN_v1
* preprocess_BO

## Dependencies

To be filled in soon.
